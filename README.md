# Real Estate Platform - QA Assessment

## Overview

This project contains a comprehensive QA assessment of a real estate platform, including manual testing documentation and automated test suite implementation.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Setup
- Set up the testing environment for the real estate platform
- Configured development and testing tools
- Installed dependencies for both the application and test suite
- Verified the application runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Manual Testing
- Performed thorough manual testing of the application
- Tested navigation flows, property listings, and user interactions
- Verified responsive design across different screen sizes
- Checked for console errors and performance issues
- **Important:** All testing was done with **mocked values only** - no real API integration exists

### 3. Test Automation
- Created 30 automated tests using Playwright
- Implemented tests for navigation, property listings, and performance
- Set up test reporting and debugging capabilities

---

## Deliverables

### 📋 QA_ASSESSMENT_BUGS.md
Complete bug report documenting all issues found during testing, including:
- Critical functionality gaps
- UI/UX inconsistencies
- Performance concerns
- Security considerations
- Detailed reproduction steps and severity ratings

### 📝 QA_ASSESSMENT_TEST_CASES.md
Comprehensive test case documentation covering:
- Functional test scenarios
- Security testing approaches
- Performance testing criteria
- Test case details with expected vs actual results

### 🤖 Automated Test Suite
Three test files covering 30 test cases:
- **tests/navigation.spec.js** - 10 tests for navigation flows
- **tests/property-listing.spec.js** - 10 tests for property display
- **tests/performance.spec.js** - 10 tests for performance metrics

---

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.x or higher
- npm package manager
- Google Chrome browser

### Step 1: Start the Application

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
example: cd /Users/brunourbano/Projects/real_estate_platform

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the application
npm start
```

Wait for the confirmation messages:
```
[0] Server running
[1] VITE ready
[1] ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

**Keep this terminal running!**

### Step 2: Run Tests in a New Terminal

```bash
# Navigate to automation directory
example: cd /Users/brunourbano/Projects/real-estate-automation

# First time only: Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test
```
---

## Test Commands

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests in headless mode
npm run test:headed   # Run with visible browser
npm run test:ui       # Interactive debug mode
npm run report        # View HTML test report
```

### Debugging Specific Tests
```bash
npx playwright test tests/navigation.spec.js --debug
npx playwright test tests/property-listing.spec.js --headed
npx playwright test tests/performance.spec.js --trace on
```

---

## Important Notes

### No Real API Integration
- The application uses **mocked values only**
- No backend API calls are made
- All data displayed is hardcoded or generated client-side
- Tests validate UI behavior with mock data

### Test Coverage

**What Tests Cover:**
- ✅ Navigation flows and routing
- ✅ UI component rendering
- ✅ Property card display
- ✅ Page load performance
- ✅ Responsive design behavior
- ✅ Console error detection

**What Tests Don't Cover:**
- ❌ Real API integration (not implemented)
- ❌ Wallet connection functionality (UI only)
- ❌ Authentication flows (not implemented)
- ❌ Smart contract interactions (not implemented)

## Test Reports

After running tests:
- HTML report: `playwright-report/index.html`
- Screenshots and videos captured on failure
- View report: `npm run report`

---

## Configuration

Test suite is configured for:
- **Base URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Default Browser:** Chrome (headless)
- **Optional Browsers:** Firefox, Safari, Mobile devices
- **Screenshots:** On failure
- **Videos:** On failure
- **Traces:** On first retry

To test other browsers, edit `playwright.config.js` and uncomment the desired browser configuration.
